## Overview
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images to accurately distinguish between the two classes. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in image classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of cats and dogs. The images are preprocessed and augmented using the `ImageDataGenerator` class from TensorFlow.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of the following layers:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Flatten layer
- Fully connected (Dense) layers with ReLU and sigmoid activation

## Training
The model is trained using the `fit` method with the following parameters:
- Steps per epoch: `train_generator.samples // 20`
- Epochs: `10`
- Validation data: `test_generator`
- Validation steps: `test_generator.samples // 20`

## Usage
To train the model, run the following code:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Data generators
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    train_dir,
    target_size=(224, 224),
    batch_size=20,
    class_mode='binary'
)
test_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    test_dir,
    target_size=(224, 224),
    batch_size=20,
    class_mode='binary'
)

# Model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=train_generator.samples // 20,
    epochs=10,
    validation_data=test_generator,
    validation_steps=test_generator.samples // 20
)
```

## Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy in classifying images of cats and dogs. The performance can be further improved by fine-tuning the model and using more advanced techniques.
